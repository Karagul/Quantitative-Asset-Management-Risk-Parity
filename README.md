Leverage Aversion and Risk Parity

1. Construct the equal-weighted bond market return, value-weighted bond market return, and lagged total bond market capitalization using CRSP Bond data 1. Your output should be from
January 1926 to December 2017, at a monthly frequency.

2. Aggregate stock, bond, and riskless datatables. For each year-month, calculate the lagged market value and excess value-weighted returns for both stocks and bonds. Your output should
be from January 1926 to December 2017, at a monthly frequency.

3. Calculate the monthly unlevered and levered risk-parity portfolio returns as defined by Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen (2012).3 For the levered risk-parity portfolio, match the value-weighted
portfolio's sigma_hat over the longest matched holding period of both. Your output should be from January 1926 to December 2017, at a monthly frequency.

4. Replicate and report Panel A of Table 2 in Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen (2012), except for Alpha and t-stat of Alpha columns. Specifically, for all strategies considered, report the
annualized average excess returns, t-statistic of the average excess returns, annualized volatility, annualized Sharpe Ratio, skewness, and excess kurtosis. Your sample should be from January
1930 to June 2010, at monthly frequency. Match the format of the table to the extent possible. Discuss the difference between your table and the table reported in the paper. It is zero? If not,
justify whether the difference is economically negligible or not. What are the reasons a nonzero difference?
